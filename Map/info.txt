Adjacency list

TERRITORY <----> ANOTHER TERRRITORY

vectors?? what are they?



		TERRITORY 
* Continent it belongs to
* Name
* list (array or vector) of adjacent territory objects
* boolean to show whether taken or not
* number of armies
FUNCTIONS:
* 

testing stuff out


		CONTINENT
* Name
* value of bonus points for capturing all territories within the continent
* list (array or vector) of countries that belong to continent

//loop till find continent name vector location (ex. vector [3])
// adjacent: loop till end of line, adding everything to a vector
// vectorOfContinents(vector[3]).setTerritory(new Terrritory(A[0],A[3],vector);


		MAP LOADER
FUNCTIONS:
* LoadMap: reads the .map file, then creates a map object which should then create a map according to the specifications of the .map file



1.mapdriver calls the map loader
2.map loader asks user for a file (should have ifs/switch statements to verify that it exists/is openable,etc.)
3.file is opened, search for "CONTINENT" keyword
4.map loader calls a method that reads every line below "CONTINENT" until the empty line. creating continent objects that get added to the vector list EX.(Europe=7)
6.search for "TERRITORIES" keyword in the file
7.call a method that adds territories to a particular continent

splits by commas, 
	1.name of territory (string pointer)
	2.continent it belongs to (we have to correlate with a value in the vector of continents) (string pointer)
	3.all adjacent territories (strin)




8.send the vector list to Map constructor and create your map





till no more territories:
map:
Territory*(A[0],A[3]);
vectorOfTerritories.push();


add adjacency list to territories
add territories to continents ...

Verification of Map:
has one and only one continent: each territory check continent, 
then check all continents and only one should match. And it should be the same continent

has adjacency:

Example (France vector[0] in the list of territories):

go through the list of all territories
check the adjacencies of that territory and see if they match the territory weâ€™re looking for
if they do return true and exit. 
If not then go to next territory in list of territories, 
repeat till found. 
If never found then the map is not connected.

hit run on the program and at the end of the demo session the program will be done :)
