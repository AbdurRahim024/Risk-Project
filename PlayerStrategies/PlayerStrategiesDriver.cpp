//create a player
//assign them a specific strategy
//print this info out on the screen
//each player does their iconic order sequence
//Human: ask for user input on deploy and advance
//Aggressive: deploy all units on strongest owned territory then advance all units (including the ones deployed) to the weakest adjacent enemy
//Benevolent: deploy all units to the weakest owned territory
//Neutral: does nothing then gets attacked (we might just remove some armies to simulate this), then turns into an Aggressive player
//Cheater: just steals all surrounding territories
