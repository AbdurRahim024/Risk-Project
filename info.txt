Adjacency list

TERRITORY <----> ANOTHER TERRRITORY

vectors?? what are they?



		TERRITORY 
* Continent it belongs to
* Name
* list (array or vector) of adjacent territory objects
* boolean to show whether taken or not
* number of armies
FUNCTIONS:
* 

testing stuff out


		CONTINENT
* Name
* value of bonus points for capturing all territories within the continent
* list (array or vector) of countries that belong to continent

//loop till find continent name vector location (ex. vector [3])
// adjacent: loop till end of line, adding everything to a vector
// vectorOfContinents(vector[3]).setTerritory(new Terrritory(A[0],A[3],vector);


		MAP LOADER
FUNCTIONS:
* LoadMap: reads the .map file, then creates a map object which should then create a map according to the specifications of the .map file



1.mapdriver calls the map loader
2.map loader asks user for a file (should have ifs/switch statements to verify that it exists/is openable,etc.)
3.file is opened, search for "CONTINENT" keyword
4.map loader calls a method that reads every line below "CONTINENT" until the empty line. creating continent objects that get added to the vector list EX.(Europe=7)
6.search for "TERRITORIES" keyword in the file
7.call a method that adds territories to a particular continent

splits by commas, 
	1.name of territory (string pointer)
	2.continent it belongs to (we have to correlate with a value in the vector of continents) (string pointer)
	3.all adjacent territories (strin)




8.send the vector list to Map constructor and create your map





till no more territories:
map:
Territory*(A[0],A[3]);
vectorOfTerritories.push();


add adjacency list to territories
add territories to continents ...
